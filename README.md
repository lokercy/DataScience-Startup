Here's how I started out to be a data scientist.

# About ME
I'm a former resident doctor working shift to shift, saving lives , comforting souls. But the whole medical system is a mess, with over-hours, low-salary and unforgiving social status. Passion and love tend to wear out. As a geeky nerd that I know I've always been and I'm wanting to be, it was time to stepped out into the world. So I guess it's a real "Hello World!"!
